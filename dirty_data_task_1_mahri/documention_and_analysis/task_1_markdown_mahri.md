This document should include:

* A brief introduction to the dataset
* A list of any assumptions you have made
* The steps you took to clean the data (you donâ€™t need to write out in detail every step, but a combination of commented code chunks with surrounding overall explanations would be great).
* The answers to the questions presented in the task brief
* Any other interesting analyses or conclusions you come across.
